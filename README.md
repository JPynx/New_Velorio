# New_Velorio
A 2D Game


Velorio is about a guy named Velorio, who had a tragic and sudden death but unfortunately, he has no memory of any of his life. His goal, using his newly found ability to slow time, is to find all the major events of his life so he can reach the afterlife before all his memories are lost to time.

As of right now there's 3 main "events" as Godot calls it.

Menu Screen, Node_2d, Character_body_2d

(Pictures are included in the sprites folder)

Menu Screen has the title screen on it and works perfectly as intended except for the text boxes of which I have no clue how to use right now.

Node_2d has the world, it has grass and a sky and collision boxes for the grass/ground

Character_body_2d is all the code for the main player that allows you to control the player and has the main sprite for the character
